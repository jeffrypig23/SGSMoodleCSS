# SGS Moodle for Stylish

Before Stylish got [busted for collecting user browser history](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/07/stylish-extension-with-2m-downloads-banished-for-tracking-every-site-visit/), I heavily used it for custom CSS. Now that it has been dropped from just about every browser, I though I would dump the files that I used here

## Looking for an alternative to Stylish?

For safari, I am currently using [FreeStyler](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=ws.freestyler.freestyler-SRV36C8E2C), and that is what the [main branch of this repo](https://github.com/jeffrypig23/SGSMoodleCSS) is for. 

For anyone else who uses a real browser, I would reccomend [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) (*Be sure not to get the names confused* ðŸ˜‰).

And lastly, for anyone useing IE... use a different browser. 

## Still looking for more alternatives?

[Here is a list of even more alternatives](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Stylish-Alternatives).



RIP Stylish. 2005 - 2018.
